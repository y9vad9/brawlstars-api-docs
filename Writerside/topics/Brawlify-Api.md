# Brawlify API
The `BrawlifyClient` is a Kotlin-based client for interacting with the Brawlify API. It provides access to various Brawl Stars data such as events, maps, icons, and game modes.
This client simplifies making HTTP requests to the API, handling JSON parsing, and providing a type-safe interface for developers.
In addition, both Brawl Stars API and Brawlify API share some of the entities, like `EventId`.

<note>
This is very basic overview of the API, I plan to extend it in the future once I get in handy with it fully. Until then,
if you're willing to help with it â€“ your contributions are welcome.

You will also have a look on the integration of it into regular Brawl Stars API in most of the tutorials.

## Creating an Instance of `BrawlifyClient`

To use the `BrawlifyClient`, you'll need an `HttpClientEngine`. You can also customize the JSON deserialization behavior and HTTP client configuration if necessary. Here's an example of how to create an instance:

```kotlin
import io.ktor.client.engine.cio.CIO
import kotlinx.serialization.json.Json

val client = BrawlifyClient(
    engine = CIO,
    // not all fields are included in API due to
    // lack of information about them (for example, some of them
    // are null in any case)
    // in addition, for forward compatibility it's always good
    // to have it
    json = Json { ignoreUnknownKeys = true },
    configBlock = {
        // Additional HttpClient configuration here
    }
)
```
